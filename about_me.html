  <h1> About Me </h1> 

   <p> I was born in the Phillipines. I moved in the U.S in the late 2012.
      In my home-country Basketball is the most known sport, everyone of 
      my friends plays it. However, back then I wasn't really into playing
      sports I was more into video games. But, when I moved into U.S my 
      brother and I would always go to the park, eventually my love for
      Basketball got stronger. </p>
